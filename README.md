- creating deb package module & snap 
- exe module for exe module we check and re-design those 
### v2.0 Beta has coming soon
- after that we have doing some applications development i.e Benmap,cydra,Hellosploit 
- no changes for brupsuite

### explanation on limited tools right now

- Our tool is designed to be a one-stop-shop for all things related to cybersecurity. It includes a variety of submenus, such as encryption and decryption, webtools, software tools, hardware tools, training platforms, and CTF platforms. These submenus contain some of the most popular and useful tools in each category, such as CyberChef for encryption and decryption, Nmap for software tools, Hak5 for hardware tools, and TryHackMe for training platforms.

- Our tool is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their level of expertise in cybersecurity. Whether you are just starting out in the field or are a seasoned cybersecurity professional, our tool has something for everyone. We have carefully selected the tools in each submenu to provide a balanced mix of functionality and usability, while also being mindful of our audience's limited time and resources.

- In the future, we plan to expand our tool by adding more submenus and tools to keep up with the rapidly changing landscape of cybersecurity. We are also planning to integrate a backend component that will allow users to save and share their results with others.

- Overall, our tool is a valuable resource for anyone interested in cybersecurity, and we are excited to share it with the world.

- the video length is more so thats why we shorted and given you sample 

- our two gols are re-directing and pre-installation for beginners we have completed the task1 the task2 we find the more components and develop our tool  

```
git clone https://github.com/Exploit0xfffff/PenetrationApp
cd PenetrationApp
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

- if do you want uninstall the application 

```
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
