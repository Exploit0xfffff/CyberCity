### Tittle: Pentration App
pentration testing in one base


### This batch implement the tools in one tool of pentration testing 

-> design âœ…

### -> create test code parts of researching (under process)

-> create main code parts 

-> Test and debug the code

-> create demo session

-> create documentation

-> sucessfully compile the code

-> update newer versions in the code

-> one of the design tool

### Explanation part:

making 1 pentration app as well as we are pre-install and redirected the apps process in all os we build the tool as soon as possible
To conduct a pentest, it is typically necessary to have a wide range of tools and skills, including:

1) Forensics tools: These are used to analyze and recover data from systems and devices, and can be used to identify the cause of a security breach or to gather evidence in an investigation.

2) Web tools: These are used to test the security of web applications and web servers, and can include tools for testing for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

3) Encryption and decryption tools: These are used to secure and decrypt data, and can be used to test the strength of an organization's encryption protocols.

4) Software tools: These are used to test the security of operating systems, applications, and networks, and can include tools for testing for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other issues.

5) Hardware tools: These are used to test the security of physical devices and systems, and can include tools for testing the security of devices such as routers, switches, and servers.

6) Capture the flag (CTF) explanation: CTFs are competitions in which participants attempt to solve challenges related to computer security, often using a combination of the tools and skills described above.

In addition to these tools and skills, it is also important for pentesters to have a strong understanding of computer systems and networks, as well as the laws and ethical principles that govern the practice of pentesting.

7) 1version we start in linux after update we will do it afer updates
